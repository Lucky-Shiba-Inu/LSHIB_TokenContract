**1. Auto Lucky Draw**
Lucky Shiba Inu grants you equal chance to win the entire lottery bag with a minimum buy. You will be able to win hundreds if not thousands of dollars all day, 24/7.

Shiba Inu buries 3% of every buy and sell transactions into the lottery pot and grants the qualifying buyer a change to win the entire pot. When certain threshold is reached, with every qualifying buy a random number will be rolled between 1-1000. If the rolled number is less than a certain number (called the chance), you will win the lottery pot. Eg, If chance set to 5%, you will have to roll any number below 50 ( 5% of 1000) to win the lottery pot. The price pool will grow bigger and bigger until a qualifying buyer rolls a number below 50.

You will be automatically enrolled into lucky draw when you buy $20 equivalent of lucky shiba inu tokens.

WHAT EFFECT DOES IT HAVE?
This unique feature increases the buy pressure as the chance to win the lucky draw with every buy is very high and it runs 24/7. You could win hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Eg, if 24 hours volume reaches just 1 million, buyers would have won $30,000 in a single day. And with qualifying buy set to as low as $20, this will make buying lucky shiba inu a habit rather than just holding it. 

Threshold, win chance percentage and the qualifying buy will be set and varied to incentivise and motivate holders to buy lucky shiba inu.
Winner will be announced by our bot in our Telegram channel.
/lottery command can be used inside our Telegram channel to view the amount currently in the lottey pot, chance to win in percentage, minimum qualifying buy, previous winner and time won.

**2. Hyper Deflation**
Luckyshibainu tokens are burned through multiple ways and removed from circulation forever. The total supply is therefore reduced which increases the value of your token.
Tokens are burned in three different ways automatically,
a) 1% of every buy and sell is burned
b) Tokens brought through buyback function is burned automatically
c) A share of rewards will be sent to the burn address by the contract
d) Periodic burning of tokens (manual burn)
This makes it truly hyper deflationary.

These tokens will be locked with Pinksale and released as per the vesting schedule. Each stage is unlocked by the current number of holders and corresponding percentage of tokens from the total supply will be burned in a split fashion over a prolonged, undisclosed time frame to avoid price spikes. 

HOW BURNING IS ACTUALLY DONE?
Burning is done by transferring the tokens directly to the burn address. Since anything that is sent to this address is forever lost and irretrievable, sending $LSHIB tokens to this address permanently reduces the circulating supply.

This can be verified through BSCScan and Moonscan.
 
WHAT EFFECT DOES IT HAVE?
Periodic burn will result in raising the price floor of the token and benefit all the holders. Also more share of the rewards function will be sent to burn wallet as this wallet grows bigger in size, effectively boosting the burn with every transaction.

These functions quickly dries up the supply to make the token scarce and increase the demand, resulting in the increase of value of the token and motivate more people to buy while retaining existing buyers.

**3. Auto Rewards**
1% of every buy and sell transaction is redistributed to all wallets holding Lucky Shiba Inu (including the burn wallet) which increases the amount of tokens that you hold considerably. Each transaction will yield $LSHIB automatically to every wallet holding Lucky Shiba Inu.

The amount of rewards received is based on the total supply of tokens that they hold.

Example : 
If Mary owns 1% of the total supply and someone buys 10,000,000 $LSHIB, Mary will receive 1000 $LSHIB tokens. Total reward amount for this transaction is 100,000 $LSHIB and then we take 1% of this to find Maryâ€™s reflected amount ie. 1000 tokens just for holding $LSHIB tokens, in one single trade that someone else did. 

WHAT EFFECT DOES IT HAVE?
This means just by having a balance of $LSHIB, you automatically will gain an interest yield over time.
It also encourages people to increase their holdings with more buys over time, as the interest yield is based on how much of the supply they own.

**4. Auto BuyBack**
1% of every buy and sell will buyback tokens automatically which will increase the buy pressure and drive the price up. 

When automatic buyback is enabled, whenever a sell is executed a portion of this buyback amount is used to automatically purchase tokens back from the liquidity pool. These purchased tokens are then immediately burned. However, the development team closely monitor this and can also opt to use it manually to prevent bots from artificially raising the price.
This feature can be automatically trigger on each sell and can also be
used manually to spike up the price of $LSHIB.

WHAT EFFECT DOES IT HAVE?
Since the bought back tokens are automatically burned, those tokens are removed from the supply forever and can never be sold in the future which effectively raises the price floor of $LSHIB. Because of the automatic buyback, investors will never see more than 2 sells in a row (95% of the time). 
This reduces panic sell and benefits all holders. 
The buyback produces a large green candle and a spike up in price. 
In manual mode the buyback can be used to neutralise the whale sale if any and raise the price floor.

Auto buyback can be switched to manual to strategically neutralise a heavy dip.  
/buyback command can be used inside our Telegram channel to view total amount in the buyback wallet in manual mode.
Manual buyback will be done in stealth mode to avoid users taking undue advantage .

**5. Auto Liquidity**
With each trade liquidity is increased making Lucky Shiba Inu progressively strong against sells and price swings, resulting in sustained value in your wallets. This makes Lucky Shiba Inu strong and less volatile.

This function automatically increases liquidity by taking a portion of each transaction and putting it towards the liquidity pool. It stores the taxed transactions inside the contract and at a swap threshold the contract will automatically take a portion of these stored tokens and sell half of them to the liquidity pool in return for BNB. It will then pair up the acquired BNB with the remaining half of the tokens that are left over, and deposit that into the liquidity pool.

WHAT EFFECT DOES IT HAVE?
Having more liquidity means that swapping $LSHIB in and out of the pool, swings the price less, effectively raising the price floor.
This makes Lucky Shiba Inu progressively stronger against selling, resulting in your wallets retaining their value more effectively. 
It also makes Lucky Shiba Inu strong and less volatile.

**6. Marketing and Development**
For development of mentioned DApps, NFTs, Casino development and third party integrations and other future utility plans suggested by the team and community.
For marketing of Lucky Shiba Inu to worldwide audience

**7. Dump Tax**
Whales dumping tokens creates uncertainty and can usually result in further panic sells from other investors looking to exit prematurely. To help alleviate this fear, we have built a mechanism called anti-pump and dump.
It is a tax bracket of 23%, imposed after a certain large amount of $LSHIB has been sold in a 24 hour bracket. This is to make whales think twice before they decide to sell large proportions of the total supply that can consequently have a negative effect on price.

WHEN DOES IT COME INTO EFFECT?
Our smart contract tracks the sell histories of each individual wallet within a 24-hour window. After a wallet has sold set threshold of $LSHIB within this timeframe, the contract will subject that wallet to a 23% fee for the next 24-hours.
This means if a whale decides to dump their entire bag, a lot more of the tokens get driven into the project to strengthen it.

WHAT EFFECT DOES IT HAVE?
This forces everyone holding huge amounts of token to be reasonable at the same time responsible, not to paint the candle in red. The optimal way to sell off is in small proportions over time.
